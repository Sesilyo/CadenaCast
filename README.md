# CadenaCast

An online voting portal web application specialized for elections with blockchain technology integration utilizing smart contracts on the voting process.

## Overview

CadenaCast is a secure blockchain-powered voting portal web application where every vote is cast with integrity, transparency, and recorded immutably. The name combines ***"kadena"*** (Filipino for "chain") and ***"cast"*** (as in casting a vote), representing the blockchain technology at the heart of our project's voting system.
